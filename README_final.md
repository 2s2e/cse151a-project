## Introduction

The purpose of our machine learning application is to allow the user to create very specific playlists that suit their needs. We aim to build a recommender system that first learns the user’s 
preferences and song associations and then allows them to provide a precise description of a playlist they’d like for the model to generate. For example, a user could ask for a playlist that 
contains a large amount of lyrics, starts slow, but has faster songs as the playlist progresses. We foresee the use of both unsupervised learning, for grouping similar songs, and supervised 
learning, for adjusting to the user’s preferences. 

We were interested in this idea because we wanted to offer the users a different and more precise personalized experience. Unlike standard recommenders that generate playlists based on your 
recently played songs which often lack nuance and flexibility in their algorithm, our application empowers users to curate playlists that resonate deeply with their unique tastes and moods. 
On top of that, our application also encourages users’ curiosity by allowing them to fine-tune the variables, thus encouraging them to explore a wider range of music that they would not have 
discovered otherwise. Furthermore, by introducing users to a wider variety of music, our application can promote diversity within the music industry and support lesser-known artists by exposing 
their work to new audiences.
